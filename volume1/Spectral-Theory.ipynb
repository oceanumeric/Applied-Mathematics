    "Spectral theory describes how to decouple the domain of a linear operator into \n",
    "a direct sum of minimal components upon which the operator is invariant. \n",
    "Choosing a basis that respects this direct sum results in a corresponding \n",
    "block-diagonal matrix representation. This has powerful consequences in \n",
    "applications, as it allows many problems to be reduced to a series of \n",
    "small individual parts that can be solved independently and more easily. \n",
    "The key tools for constructing this decomposition are eigenvalues and \n",
    "eigenvectors, which are widely used in many areas of science and engineering \n",
    "and have many important physical interpretations and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most finite-dimensional linear operators have eigenvectors that span the \n",
    "space (hereafter called an eigenbasis) where the corresponding matrix \n",
    "representation is diagonal. In other words, a change of basis to the \n",
    "eigenbasis shows that such a matrix operator is similar to a diagonal matrix. \n",
    "That said, not all matrices can be diagonalized, and some can only be made \n",
    "block diagonal. In the first sections of this chapter, we develop this \n",
    "theory and expound on when a matrix can be diagonalized and when we \n",
    "must settle for block diagonalization."
